### Project Description:
In this assignment I learned how to use Apixu to gather live weather data and add it into a cloud9 workspace. By doing this I was able to view current temperatures.

### View Project:
https://chc14.github.io/WeatherChannel/. 


### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how to use the website Apixu and take advantage of the API (Application Programming Interface) to create an application that tells you current weather of the city you type in.
2. I learned that AJAX communicates to the server or the database for me. When they do this I am able to upload certain parts of that database like the weather.
3. I finally learned that Javascript Object Notation is the format that allowed me to transfer data between the server and my project. One example of the code is json.location.name that allowed the program to get the location name of the city/zipcode typed in.
